'''
Write a function that takes in an array of integers and returns a booly representing 
weather the array is monotonic. 
An array is monotonic if its elements, from left to right, are entirely non-increasing or entirely

Non-increasing elements arent necessarily exclusivly decreasing; they simply dont increase. Similarly 
with non-decreasing. 
Note that empty arrays and arrays of one element are monotonic.
